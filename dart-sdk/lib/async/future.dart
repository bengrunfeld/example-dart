/**
 * An object representing a delayed computation.
 *
 * A [Future] is used to obtain a not yet
 * available value, or error, sometime in the future.  Receivers of a
 * [Future] can register callbacks that handle the value or error once it is
 * available. For example:
 *
 *     Future<int> future = getFuture();
 *     future.then((value) => handleValue(value))
 *           .catchError((error) => handleError(error));
 *
 * A [Future] can be completed in two ways: with a value ("the future succeeds")
 * or with an error ("the future fails"). Users can install callbacks for each
 * case. The result of registering a pair of callbacks is a new Future (the
 * "successor") which in turn is completed with the result of invoking the
 * corresponding callback. The successor is completed with an error if the
 * invoked callback throws. For example:
 *
 *     Future<int> successor = future.then((int value) {
 *         // Invoked when the future is completed with a value.
 *         return 42;  // The successor is completed with the value 42.
 *       },
 *       onError: (e) {
 *         // Invoked when the future is completed with an error.
 *         if (canHandle(e)) {
 *           return 499;  // The successor is completed with the value 499.
 *         } else {
 *           throw e;  // The successor is completed with the error e.
 *         }
 *       });
 *
 * If a future does not have a successor but is completed with an error, it
 * forwards the error message to the global error-handler. This special casing
 * makes sure that no error is silently dropped. However, it also means that
 * error handlers should be installed early, so that they are present as soon
 * as a future is completed with an error. The following example demonstrates
 * this potential bug:
 *
 *     var future = getFuture();
 *     new Timer(new Duration(milliseconds: 5), () {
 *       // The error-handler is only attached 5ms after the future has been
 *       // received. If the future fails in the mean-time it will forward the
 *       // error to the global error-handler, even though there is code (just
 *       // below) to handle the error.
 *       future.then((value) { useValue(value); },
 *                   onError: (e) { handleError(e); });
 *     });
 *
 * In general we discourage registering the two callbacks at the same time, but
 * prefer to use [then] with one argument (the value handler), and to use
 * [catchError] for handling errors. The missing callbacks (the error-handler
 * for [then], and the value-handler for [catchError]), are automatically
 * configured to "forward" the value/error. Separating value and error-handling
 * into separate registration calls usually leads to code that is easier to
 * reason about. In fact it makes asynchronous code very similar to synchronous
 * code:
 *
 *     // Synchronous code.
 *     try {
 *       int value = foo();
 *       return bar(value);
 *     } catch (e) {
 *       return 499;
 *     }
 *
 *  Equivalent asynchronous code, based on futures:
 *
 *     Future<int> future = foo();  // foo now returns a future.
 *     future.then((int value) => bar(value))
 *           .catchError((e) => 499);
 *
 * Similar to the synchronous code, the error handler (registered with
 * [catchError]) is handling the errors for exceptions coming from calls to
 * 'foo', as well as 'bar'. This would not be the case if the error-handler was
 * registered at the same time as the value-handler.
 *
 * Futures can have more than one callback-pairs registered. Each successor is
 * treated independently and is handled as if it was the only successor.
