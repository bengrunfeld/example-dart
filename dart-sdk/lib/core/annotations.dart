/**
 * The annotation "@Deprecated('expires when')" marks a feature as deprecated.
 *
 * The annotation "@deprecated" is a shorthand for deprecating until
 * to an unspecified "next release".
 *
 * The intent of the "@Deprecated" annotation is to inform users of a feature
 * that they should change their code, even if it is currently still working
 * correctly.
 *
 * A deprecated feature is scheduled to be removed at a later time, possibly
 * specified as the "expires" field of the annotation.
 * This means that a deprecated feature should not be used, or code using it
 * will break at some point in the future. If there is code using the feature,
 * that code should be rewritten to not use the deprecated feature.
 *
 * A deprecated feature should document how the same effect can be achieved,
 * so the programmer knows how to rewrite the code.
 *
 * The "@Deprecated" annotation applies to libraries, top-level declarations
 * (variables, getters, setters, functions, classes and typedefs),
 * class-level declarations (variables, getters, setters, methods, operators or
 * constructors, whether static or not), named optional arguments and
 * trailing optional positional parameters.
 *
 * Deprecation is transitive:
 *
 *  - If a library is deprecated, so is every member of it.
 *  - If a class is deprecated, so is every member of it.
 *  - If a variable is deprecated, so are its implicit getter and setter.
 *
 *
 * A tool that processes Dart source code may report when:
 *
 * - the code imports a deprecated library.
 * - the code exports a deprecated library, or any deprecated member of
 *  Â a non-deprecated library.
 * - the code refers statically to a deprecated declaration.
 * - the code dynamically uses a member of an object with a statically known
 *   type, where the member is deprecated on the static type of the object.
 * - the code dynamically calls a method with an argument where the
 *   corresponding optional parameter is deprecated on the object's static type.
 *
 *
 * If the deprecated use is inside a library, class or method which is itself
 * deprecated, the tool should not bother the user about it.
 * A deprecated feature is expected to use other deprecated features.

   * This can be specified, for example, as a date, as a release number, or
   * as relative to some other change (like "when bug 4418 is fixed").

/*
 * The annotation "@override" marks an instance member as overriding a
 * superclass member with the same name.
 *
 * The annotation applies to instance methods, getters and setters, and to
 * instance fields, where it means that the implicit getter and setter of the
 * field is marked as overriding, but the field itself is not.
 *
 * A tool may report if no declaration of an annotated member is inherited by
 * the class from either a superclass or an interface.
 *
 * The intent of the "override" notation is to catch situations where a
 * superclass renames a member, and an independent subclass which used to
 * override the member, could silently continue working using the
 * superclass implementation.
 *
 * The "@override" annotation is intentionally not used in the core libraries.
 * It is intended for the editor, or similar tools, to support user written
 * code.
